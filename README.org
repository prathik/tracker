* Tracker
** Summary
Tracker enables you to optimize your work by tracking tasks that you did and subjective feelings around it. This data can later be used to thinking about how to improve both impact and joy of your work.

** Background
*** Flow State
[[flow.jpg]]

Flow happens when skill meets challenge. In *tracker* we regularly monitor whether the work challenge or effort matches
our skill level.

*** Pomodoro

Pomodoro is a time boxing method where you set a distraction free time to do focused work.

** Goals
1. Easy tracking of flow states through out the day
2. Easy tracking of pomodoro sessions
3. Increase happiness and impact of work

** Future work
1. Incorporate GTD

** How?
*** Daily
1. Set a time slot for work ie 25 minutes
2. Start counter
3. Work
4. When counter ends run `tracker increment <challenge-level>`
5. Take a 5 minute (or whatever is comfortable) break
6. goto step 1 if done < k or stop

*** Weekly Retro
Run `tracker show` weekly and then optimize for flow and pomodoro sessions.

** Installation

*** Install Go
https://golang.org/doc/install
