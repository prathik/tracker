* Pomodoro Tracker
** Summary
Track the number of pomodoro sessions done
** Background
Currently I operate via pomodoro, running a total of 12 sessions of 25 minutes each. One of the key issues is a lack of fast way to track the number of pomodoro sessions that were done.
** Goals
1. Track total pomodoro donerun should be visible
2. Have a quick and easy way to track the same
3. The Pomodoro sessions trend should be visible
** Plan
Create a single person web server that takes in when work was completed.
